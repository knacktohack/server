INSIDER TRADING AND
INDIAN STOCK MARKET
ABSTRACT
'Insider trading' in financial markets refers to trading in securities such as equity
and bonds by company insiders who have access to exclusive information about the issuer of a
particular security before such information is released to the general public. This allows insiders to
benefit from buying or selling shares before they fluctuate in price.
Insider trading has been present throughout the history of financial markets, and was
particularly prevalent during periods of elementary years of Indian stock markets. Insider trading
is common in developing countries like India, where it is practiced by a wide range of market
participants, corporate officers and regulative authorities. Primary insiders gain access to
information by virtue of their position, employment or responsibility. They include controlling
shareholders, corporate executives and officers, as well as financial-market professionals who
compile information on a firm's operation. Government officials with access to insider
information also fall into this category. Secondary insiders are friends or relatives of primary
insiders. Dynamic regulations not only help reduce the impact of such events but also help in
restoring stability.
This study reviews the Insider Trading provisions in the Securities Market of India
and the emerging trends and issues.

INSIDER TRADING - An Introduction
Insider Trading essentially denotes dealing in a company's securities on the basis
of confidential information, relating to the company, which is not published or not known to the
public, also called as unpublished price sensitive information, used to make personal profits or
avoid loss. It is fairly a breach of fiduciary duties of officers of a company. It arises when an
individual with potential access to non-public information about a company buys or sells shares
or stocks of that company. The practice of Insider Trading came into existence ever since the
very concept of trading of securities of joint stock companies became prevalent among the
investors worldwide and has now become a formidable challenge.
The growing magnitude of the worlds' securities markets wherein trading in shares,
derivatives and bonds takes place at international levels has further raised the concerns of the
regulators all over the world. Insider trading caught attention of the public and the government
owing to them suspecting unusual profit/gain of businessperson as well as shareholders. The
Companies Act in India has exhibited dearth of competency to resolve trading issues along with
limiting unfair trading.
The SEBI Act was enacted in the year 1992 to provide a regulatory framework to
promote healthy trading and protect investors' interest to ensure growth of securities market.
Under Section 11(1), 11(2) of SEBI Act and Section 30, SEBI has the legal power to intervene
and prevent insider trading while the said sections also implement further regulations to limit
illegal activities. The first case regarding violation of insider trading regulation was registered
against Hindustan Lever Limited in India.
Insider trading is an extremely complex issue and it is almost impossible to get rid of it
because it evolves from a very basic human instinct i.e., greed. One who is having insider
information and arrive at a decision of future profit or reduction of loss by discounting such
information, it is extremely difficult for him to keep himself abstained from trading based on
that information. Present effort is an endeavor to understand the magnitude of this problem and
regulatory practices that exist to combat it.

LITERATURE REVIEW
Rishikesh Desai and Yosham Desai (2010) in their article states that one of the
fundamental and most general principles of law is that when any individual acquires any kind of
special knowledge or price sensitive information by virtue of his or her confidential or fiduciary
relationship with another individual, he cannot use such knowledge or information to his own
advantage or for his own personal benefit and must account for any such profit so derived.
C. Koch Von (2014) says that the insiders regulate the price and status of stock market
being aware of the firm's condition. UPSI is the key factor in insider trading while lack of
monitoring, supervision and regulatory framework implicated in economic collapse of firms as
well as nations.
Yesha Yadav (2016) in her research paper "Insider Trading and Market Structure"
argues that the emergence of algorithmic trading raises a significant challenge for the law and
policy of insider trading. It shows that the securities market are dominated by a cohort of
"structural insiders" namely a set of traders able to utilize close physical and informational
access to trade at speeds measured in milliseconds and microseconds, a practice loosely termed
as high frequency trading (HFT).
Anil K. Manchikatla and Rajesh H. Acharya (2017) state the term insider trading is
subject to many definitions and connotations and it encompasses both legal and prohibited
activity. When a corporate insider trades by adhering to all regulations, it is called legal insider
trading, and any violation of that amounts to prohibited insider trading. The past several decades
have witnessed an increase in insider trading.
As per Vinita Sharma (2016) as the world continues to shrink, global financial markets
are expanding and trading of shares, bonds, derivatives and other instruments continues to
increase. These markets are the lifeline of capitalist economies, bringing in the much needed
investment to fuel economic growth. A natural corollary to this function is the need for dynamic
regulation that keeps pace with new developments - domestic as well as global to ensure global
financial stability. Growing investments of middle classes of their savings in equity investment
across the global markets makes it imperative that market fraud be taken seriously.

existing legal frame work is deemed to be inadequate in the present globalized era of financial
market.

literacy, etc. and investment in the stock market.
RESEARCH METHODOLOGY
The present study is exploratory cum descriptive in nature as the researcher has to study
the investment pattern in the securities market in India and impact of insider trading on the
same.
RESEARCH FINDING
Insider trading is when some persons make extra gains in stock market through use of
some undisclosed information, like information on expected dividends, expected decline or rise
in profits, any information on acquisition, merger, potential threats etc. or any other price-
sensitive information.
In the Indian context, the term insider is used for those who have direct or indirect
connection to the organization or otherwise and have access to unpublished price sensitive
information. Insiders can be connected individual or relatives but fact to be considered in this
regard is the accessibility to unpublished price sensitive information. The individual who have
any scope to get access or obtain unpublished price sensitive information of one company or
group of companies is also liable to be marked as an insider. Accessibility and possession of
unpublished price sensitive information is a major aspect to be considered as insider in Indian
legal context.

Insider trading is an extremely complex issue and it is almost impossible to get rid of
it because it evolves from a very basic human instinct i.e., greed. One who is having insider
information arrive at a decision of future profit or reduction of loss by discounting such
information, it is extremely difficult for him to keep himself abstained from trading based
on that information.
Present effort is an endeavor to understand the magnitude of this problem and
regulatory practices that exist to combat it. Stock market is also important and an effective
way of allocating scarce resources from surplus unit to deficit unit.
However, this is only possible where different segments of the financial markets are
able to operate efficiently. The competition for external capital amongst small, developing
and emerging financial markets has resulted in a growing awareness of the importance of
investor protection laws if markets are to be competitive and hence a need to control the
behavior of insiders who are involved in illegal insider trading is felt.

CONCLUSION
The impact, extent and effects of insider trading might vary in each country but any
amount of insider trading has a massive effect on the reputation of the country. Every
shareholder invests his money in the market with the prior faith of transparency and efficiency
in the market. Any investor while making his decision about investment (to sell, buy or hold
stock) relies upon the available price sensitive information provided by the listed company in the
stock exchange. The investment into securities market has increased many folds in recent times.
The globalization has created many ways to invest money and investment is being made all over
the world by citizens of different nations.
When an investor relies upon the available price sensitive information, he has the prior
thought of trust about the correctness of the value of the security he is trading. Even after
making the price sensitive information public, still one segment of the company has the
information which finally decides the value of the security. When such persons use this
information to invest in the market they are known as 'Insiders'. Such insiders get the price
sensitive information prior to the listing of the stocks in the market because of the position they
are holding in the company. When such persons pass such information to other or use the same
for their benefit either to buy or sell the shares, they are involved in insider trading.
Over the last few decades, world securities markets have become significantly more
sophisticated in terms of how securities are traded as well as the variety of securities traded. The
integrity of securities markets is critical to the economy of a country and it is necessary for
regulators to enforce laws, prohibiting market abuse in order to protect market integrity. As a
result of these changes, markets are becoming truly global, thereby, allowing traders to trade
almost instantly across a wide variety of products and in markets around the world.
